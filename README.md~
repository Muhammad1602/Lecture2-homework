You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are
also known as functions.

- charAt()
> The charAt() method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string.

-  concat()
> The concat() method joins two or more strings.

- replace()
> The replace() method searches a string for a value or a regular expression.

- replaceAll()
> The replaceAll() method returns a new string with all matches of a pattern replaced by
a replacement.

- split()
>The split() method splits a string into an array of substrings. The split() method returns the new
array. The split() method does not change the original string. If (" ") is used as separator, the string
is split between words.

- substr(start, length)
>The substr() method extracts a part of a string.
The substr() method begins at a specified position, and returns a specified number of characters.
The substr() method does not change the original string.
To extract characters from the end of the string, use a negative start position.

- substring(start,end)
>The substring() method extracts characters, between two indices (positions), from a string, and
returns the substring.
The substring() method extracts characters from start to end (exclusive).
The substring() method does not change the original string.
If start is greater than end, arguments are swapped: (4, 1) = (1, 4).
Start or end values less than 0, are treated as 0.

- slice(start, end)
>The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object
selected from start to end ( end not included) where start and end represent the index of items
in that array.

- toLowerCase()
>The toLowerCase() method converts a string to lowercase letters.

- toUpperCase()
>The toUpperCase() method converts a string to uppercase letters, using current locale.

- trim()
>Method trim() removes whitespace from both sides of a string

- includes()
>The includes() method returns true if a string contains a specified string.
Otherwise it returns false.

- search()
>The search() method matches a string against a regular expression **
The search() method returns the index (position) of the first match.
The search() method returns -1 if no match is found.

- toString()
>The toString() method returns a string representing the object.
By default toString() takes no parameters.

-  indexOf()
>The indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence of a value in a string.
The indexOf() method returns -1 if the value is not found.

- repeat()
>The repeat() method creates a new string by repeating the given string a specified number of
times and returns it.

- Math.floor()
> The Math.floor() function rounds down a number to the next smallest integer.

-  Math.round()
> The Math.round() function returns the number rounded to the nearest integer.

- ceil()
> The ceil() method rounds a decimal number up to the next largest integer and returns it.

- Math.max() 
> The max() method finds the maximum value among the specified values and returns it.

- Math.min()
>The min() method finds the minimum value among the specified values and returns it.

- Math.pow()
>The pow() method computes the power of a number by raising the second argument
to the power of the first argument.

-  Math.sqrt()
>The sqrt() method computes the square root of a specified number and returns it

- Math.abs()
>The abs() method finds the absolute value of the specified number (without any sign) and returns it.

- Math.random()
>The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive)
and 1 (exclusive).

-  isNaN()
>The isNaN() function checks if a value is NaN (Not-a-Number) or not.
